    "This are my notes while following the [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/index.html) _Practical Deep Learning For Coders_ course.  While I have experience with statistics and data analysis in R and Python, starting the course, I had very little practice with Linux systems and had trouble getting basic things done on the terminal (like copying files, making directories, etc.).  I hope this post can help others who are eager to learn deep learning hands-on, but, like me, get stuck before the learning starts!"

    "I started the course towards the end of may 2018.  Right at the end of lesson 1, and eager to try by myself to the dogs-vs-cats classifier, I registered in Paperspace and tried to create a new machine with the fast.ai public template.  However, a message appeared stating that _This instance type has not been enabled in your account yet_.  I filled the request and, three weeks later, haven't heard back.  I also tried the free hour in Crestle, but decided to follow the recomendations towards the end of lesson 2 and try Amazon Web Services (AWS). \n",

    "I followed all the steps in the [lesson 2 video](https://youtu.be/JNxcznsrRb8?t=1h57m19s), but when I ran the notebook on an instance of the fast.ai AMI, `torch.cuda.is_available()` returned `False`.  Then, I found this [post](See http://forums.fast.ai/t/torch-cuda-is-available-returns-false/16721/), in which the author finally decides to use the Amazon Deep Learning AMI (see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/get-started-with-deep-learning-using-the-aws-deep-learning-ami/) for the basic part of the setup)."
